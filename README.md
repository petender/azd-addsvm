## Azure VM As ADDS Domain Controller with Bastion

This repo contains a demo for an Azure VM, running Windows 22 as ADDS - Active Directory Domain Controller with local DNS. The VM is remotely reachable through Azure Bastion, which is integrated into the deployment.
A dummy internal DNS domain gets created sub1.mttdemodomain.com

You will get prompted during the AZD deployment step for the adminusername and adminpassword parameters. Make sure it follows the [Azure VM username requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-username-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-) as well as [Azure VM password requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-)

In a later stage, we might run an additional script to create sample users and OUs. 

This scenario can be deployed to Azure using the [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview). 

üí™ This template scenario is part of the larger **[Microsoft Trainer Demo Deploy Catalog](https://aka.ms/trainer-demo-deploy)**.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
- [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
    - When installing AZD, the above the following tools will be installed on your machine as well, if not already installed:
        - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
        - [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
    - You need Owner or Contributor access permissions to an Azure Subscription to  deploy the scenario.

## üöÄ Deploying the scenario in 3 easy steps:

1. From within a new folder on your machine, run `azd init` to initialize the deployment.
```
azd init -t petender/azd-addsvm
```
2. Next, run `azd up` to trigger an actual deployment.
```
azd up
```
3. If you want to delete the scenario from your Azure subscription, use `azd down`
```
azd down --purge --force
```

‚è© Note: running `azd down` deletes the RG and Resources, but will keep the artifacts on your local machine.
